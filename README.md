# ml-zoomcamp
 Code as part of homework, or additional material as part of the [Machine Learning Engineering course](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp) by Alexey Grigorev.
- Week 1 - 4, Week 6 Code
	- For Week 1, we only have the homework since there I personally have not written any code for Week 1. This is because I have prior experience to NumPy, as well as Pandas. 
	- All of my notebooks are on Kaggle instead, since that is the environment I first used when I started this course. The homework is linked as well, but not all the answers are correct.

- Midterm Project
	- Midterm Project is in a [separate repository](https://github.com/kwangyy/midterm-project)
	- The AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment is not working because I have terminated it, in order to not be charged money for it.
